# chess-score-sheet
A sheet for recording chess moves.

I use pdflatex to compile the source file.

This is in English and Turkish now, but I'd like to make it more
multilingual. Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.  The language
dependent parts are in a seperate file, I think it is self-explanatory
how to add support for an additional language, but feel free to ask of
course.
